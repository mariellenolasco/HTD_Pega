## Data Objects
Data objects are a collection of data types meant to represent some entity. For example a customer may have attributes such as name, address, contact information. In out application we may need a customer object to represent the customer entity so we cal fulfill orders. So the customer object will have a string name, string address, and maybe another data type for the contact information. Grouping data in objects helps organize how we pass data in an application as well as structure the data once we save it to storage such as the database.
