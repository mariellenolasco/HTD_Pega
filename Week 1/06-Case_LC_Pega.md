# Case Lifescycle Pega
In Pega, the Case Lifecycle refers to the stages and transitions that a case goes through from its creation to its resolution. A case represents a specific unit of work or a business process within a Pega application. The Case Lifecycle defines the sequence of steps, actions, and decisions involved in managing and processing a case.

Here are the key components of the Case Lifecycle in Pega:

1. **Case Creation**: The lifecycle begins when a case is created in the Pega application. This can be initiated manually by a user, automatically triggered by an event or business rule, or through integration with external systems.

2. **Stage Progression**: A case typically progresses through multiple stages or phases as it moves towards resolution. Each stage represents a significant step in the case lifecycle and may involve different activities, tasks, or approvals.

3. **Flow Actions**: Flow actions are user interface components that allow users to perform actions or advance the case to the next stage. Flow actions can be configured to collect information, make decisions, trigger processes, or interact with external systems.

4. **Assignments**: Assignments represent work items or tasks that need to be completed as part of the case lifecycle. Assignments are assigned to users or groups based on predefined rules, roles, or skills.

5. **Decision Points**: Decision points are checkpoints in the case lifecycle where decisions need to be made based on certain conditions or criteria. Decisions may determine the next course of action, route the case to different stages, or escalate issues for resolution.

6. **Approval Processes**: Cases may require approvals from stakeholders or reviewers at various stages of the lifecycle. Approval processes define the rules, criteria, and participants involved in reviewing and approving case actions or decisions.

7. **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**: SLAs define the expected response times or deadlines for completing tasks or resolving cases. SLAs are used to monitor and track case performance, ensure timely resolution, and enforce service level commitments.

8. **Resolution and Closure**: The case lifecycle culminates in the resolution and closure of the case. This may involve finalizing documentation, updating records, notifying stakeholders, and archiving case data.

Overall, the Case Lifecycle in Pega provides a structured framework for managing and automating business processes, ensuring consistent and efficient handling of cases across the organization. It enables organizations to streamline workflows, improve collaboration, and deliver better outcomes for customers and stakeholders.

## Case vs CaseType
In Pega, cases and case types are related concepts, but they represent different aspects of the application's data structure and functionality. Here's the difference between cases and case types in Pega:

1. **Cases**:
   - A case represents a specific unit of work or a business process within a Pega application.
   - It represents an instance of a particular case type, capturing the data, actions, and history associated with a specific occurrence of that process.
   - Cases are created and managed within the application to track and progress individual instances of work through their lifecycle.
   - Examples of cases include customer service requests, insurance claims, loan applications, purchase orders, and service tickets.
   - Each case has its own unique identifier, data, status, history, and associated tasks or actions.

2. **Case Types**:
   - A case type defines the template or blueprint for a specific type of case within the Pega application.
   - It specifies the structure, behavior, data model, user interface, processes, and rules associated with that type of case.
   - Case types are designed and configured using Pega's Case Designer or Case Type rule form.
   - Case types define the common attributes, properties, and behaviors that all instances of that case type will inherit.
   - Examples of case types include "Customer Service Request," "Insurance Claim," "Loan Application," "Purchase Order," and "Service Ticket."
   - Case types provide a reusable and configurable framework for defining and managing different types of cases within the application.

In summary, cases represent individual instances of work or business processes, while case types define the templates or blueprints for those processes. Cases are specific occurrences or instantiations of case types, capturing the data and actions associated with a particular instance of work. Case types provide the structure, rules, and behaviors that govern how cases are created, processed, and managed within the application.

## Different parts of a case workflow
In Pega, stages, processes, and steps are key components used to define the workflow and structure of a case. Each serves a specific purpose within the case lifecycle, but they have distinct roles and characteristics. Here are the differences between stages, processes, and steps in Pega:

1. **Stages**:
   - Stages represent major milestones or phases in the case lifecycle.
   - They define the high-level progression of the case and are used to organize and categorize related activities and processes.
   - Stages typically represent significant checkpoints, milestones, or states that the case progresses through, such as "Initiation," "Review," "Approval," and "Closure."
   - Stages are visualized as swimlanes or columns in the case designer, providing a high-level overview of the case flow.
   - Stages do not contain specific actions or tasks but serve as containers for processes and subprocesses.

2. **Processes**:
   - Processes represent the detailed sequence of tasks, activities, and decisions that need to be performed within a stage.
   - They define the specific steps and actions required to advance the case from one stage to another.
   - Processes are composed of flow shapes, such as assignments, flow actions, decision shapes, and connectors, which represent individual tasks, actions, or decision points.
   - Processes are modeled using flow diagrams in Pega's Case Designer or Flow rule forms.
   - Processes can include conditional logic, branching, looping, and other control structures to guide case flow based on business rules and requirements.
   - Processes may include subprocesses or child flows, allowing for modularization and reuse of common workflows.

3. **Steps**:
   - Steps are the smallest units of work or actions within a process.
   - They represent individual tasks, actions, or activities that need to be completed as part of the case workflow.
   - Steps can include user interactions, system actions, decision points, integrations with external systems, and other actions.
   - Steps are represented by flow shapes, such as assignments, flow actions, decision shapes, utility shapes, and connectors, in the process flow diagram.
   - Steps are executed sequentially within the process flow, following the defined sequence of the process.
   - Steps may have associated properties, rules, conditions, and outcomes that determine their behavior and execution.

In summary, stages represent high-level phases or milestones, processes define the detailed workflow within each stage, and steps represent the individual actions or tasks within a process. Together, they provide a structured framework for modeling, automating, and managing case workflows in Pega applications.
