# Configuring data types, data objects, data relationships, and field types

In Pega, several concepts are fundamental to understanding how data is managed and represented within the application. Here's an explanation of data types, data objects, data relationships, and field types in Pega:

1. **Data Types**:
   - Data types define the structure and format of data elements within the application.
   - Pega provides various data types that developers can use to represent different types of data, such as text, numbers, dates, boolean values, and more.
   - Examples of data types in Pega include Text, Integer, Decimal, Date, DateTime, Boolean, Page, List, Group, and Embedded Property.
   - Data types define the properties and attributes of data elements, including their names, data formats, validation rules, and relationships with other data elements.
   - Data types are used to define the data model of the application, which represents the structure of the data and how it is organized and managed within the application.

2. **Data Objects**:
   - Data objects represent instances of data elements within the application.
   - They encapsulate the actual data values and state of individual data elements at runtime.
   - Data objects are created, manipulated, and accessed by the application to store and retrieve data as needed.
   - Examples of data objects in Pega include cases, work items, customer records, transaction records, and other entities that represent real-world objects or concepts.
   - Data objects are instances of data types and inherit the properties, attributes, and behaviors defined by their corresponding data types.

3. **Data Relationships**:
   - Data relationships define the associations and connections between different data elements within the application.
   - They represent the dependencies, hierarchies, and connections among data objects and data elements.
   - Examples of data relationships in Pega include parent-child relationships, one-to-many relationships, many-to-many relationships, and associations between related entities.
   - Data relationships are established using various mechanisms such as property references, embedded properties, page lists, data pages, data transforms, and declarative relationships.

4. **Field Types**:
   - Field types define the presentation and behavior of data elements within the user interface of the application.
   - They determine how data elements are displayed, captured, and interacted with by users.
   - Examples of field types in Pega include input fields, dropdown lists, checkboxes, radio buttons, date pickers, text areas, and labels.
   - Field types are associated with specific data types and control the formatting, validation, and behavior of data elements within the UI.
   - Field types are defined using UI components such as sections, controls, layouts, and dynamic layouts within the application's UI rules.

In summary, data types define the structure and format of data elements, data objects represent instances of data elements, data relationships define associations between data elements, and field types control the presentation and behavior of data elements within the user interface. Together, these concepts form the foundation of data management and representation in Pega applications.
