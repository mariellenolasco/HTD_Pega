# Calculated Values
In Pega, calculated values refer to dynamically computed values that are derived based on predefined expressions or formulas. These values are calculated at runtime and can be used to populate fields, properties, or variables within the application. Calculated values provide a powerful mechanism for performing calculations, transformations, and logic-based operations on data within Pega applications.

Here are some different ways to calculate values in Pega:

1. **Expression Builder**: Pega provides an Expression Builder tool that allows developers to define calculated values using a graphical interface. The Expression Builder allows developers to create complex expressions and formulas using a wide range of operators, functions, properties, and constants.

2. **Data Transformations**: Calculated values can be defined within data transform rules, which are used to transform and manipulate data between different data structures. Data transform rules allow developers to perform calculations, transformations, mappings, and validations on data elements.

3. **Validation Rules**: Calculated values can be used within validation rules to perform dynamic validations on data entered by users. Validation rules allow developers to define conditions and expressions that determine whether data is valid or not based on calculated values.

4. **Field Value Rules**: Calculated values can be defined within field value rules, which are used to calculate and set the value of fields or properties within the application. Field value rules allow developers to dynamically populate fields with values based on predefined logic or conditions.

## Use Cases: 

Calculated values are commonly used in various use cases within Pega applications, such as:
   - Calculating totals, averages, or aggregates based on data from multiple sources.
   - Applying conditional logic to determine the value of a field or property based on specific conditions.
   - Performing date and time calculations, string manipulations, mathematical operations, or business rule evaluations.
   - Transforming data between different formats, structures, or representations.
   - Enforcing business rules, constraints, or validations based on calculated values.

Overall, calculated values provide a flexible and powerful mechanism for performing dynamic calculations, transformations, and logic-based operations on data within Pega applications. They enable developers to build sophisticated business logic, automate processes, and enhance the functionality and usability of the application.
