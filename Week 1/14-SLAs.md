# Service Level Agreements in Pega
In Pega, Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are used to define and manage the expected response times or deadlines for completing tasks, activities, or cases within the application. SLAs provide a mechanism for measuring and monitoring the performance, efficiency, and compliance of business processes with predefined service level targets. Here's an overview of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in Pega:

1. **Definition and Configuration**:
   - SLAs are defined and configured within the application using SLA rules.
   - SLA rules specify the target goals, deadlines, conditions, and escalation actions associated with specific tasks, activities, or cases.
   - SLAs can be defined at different levels of granularity, such as at the case type level, stage level, or individual assignment level.

2. **SLA Metrics**:
   - SLAs define various metrics and parameters to measure the performance and compliance of tasks or cases.
   - Common SLA metrics include:
     - **Goal**: The target goal or deadline for completing the task or case.
     - **Deadline**: The maximum allowed time for completing the task or case.
     - **Warning Time**: The threshold time before the deadline when a warning or notification is triggered.
     - **Elapsed Time**: The actual time elapsed since the task or case started.
     - **Remaining Time**: The remaining time until the deadline.
     - **Completion Status**: Indicates whether the task or case was completed within the SLA deadline.

3. **Actions and Escalations**:
   - SLAs define actions and escalation mechanisms to handle deviations from the predefined service level targets.
   - Actions may include sending notifications, alerts, or reminders to stakeholders when certain SLA thresholds are met or exceeded.
   - Escalations may involve automatically reassigning tasks, escalating issues to higher-level managers, or triggering additional actions to ensure timely resolution.

4. **Monitoring and Reporting**:
   - Pega provides monitoring and reporting capabilities to track and analyze SLA performance across tasks, cases, and assignments.
   - Users can view SLA status, metrics, trends, and compliance reports within the application to monitor performance and identify areas for improvement.
   - SLA reports may include dashboards, charts, graphs, and tables displaying SLA metrics, trends, and historical data.

5. **Customization and Extensibility**:
   - SLAs in Pega are highly customizable and extensible to meet specific business requirements.
   - Developers can define custom SLA rules, metrics, conditions, and actions tailored to the needs of the application.
   - SLA functionality can be extended using integration with external systems, business rules, decision logic, and workflow automation.

Overall, Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in Pega play a crucial role in ensuring that tasks, activities, and cases are completed within predefined service level targets, thereby improving efficiency, accountability, and customer satisfaction within the application.
