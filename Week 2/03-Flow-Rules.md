# Flow Rules
In Pega, flow rules are an essential part of building business process management (BPM) applications. A flow rule defines the sequence of steps that an object (typically referred to as a "work item" or "case") follows as it progresses through a business process. These steps can include user interactions, automated actions, decision points, and integrations with external systems.

Here's an overview of key aspects of flow rules in Pega:

1. **Flow Diagram**: Flow rules are represented visually using a flow diagram, which displays the sequence of steps and the transitions between them. The diagram provides a clear and intuitive way to understand the flow of the business process.

2. **Flow Actions**: Each step in a flow rule is called a "flow action." Flow actions can be tasks that need to be completed, decisions that need to be made, or actions that trigger some automated processing. Examples of flow actions include gathering information from a user, performing calculations, sending notifications, or invoking external services.

3. **Routing and Transitions**: Transitions between flow actions define the logic for how the work item progresses through the process. Transitions can be conditional, based on certain criteria being met, or unconditional, proceeding regardless of conditions. Routing logic in Pega determines which path the work item follows based on the outcomes of decision points or other conditions.

4. **Integration**: Flow rules often incorporate integration points with external systems or services. This could involve calling APIs, updating databases, sending emails, or interacting with other applications.

5. **Life Cycle Management**: Flow rules play a crucial role in defining the life cycle of a work item or case within a Pega application. They determine the sequence of steps that need to be completed and the conditions under which a work item can progress from one stage to the next.

6. **Reusability and Modularity**: Flow rules can be designed for reuse across multiple processes or applications. Pega's rule-based architecture allows for the creation of modular and reusable components, promoting consistency and efficiency in application development.

Overall, flow rules in Pega provide a powerful mechanism for modeling, automating, and managing complex business processes within BPM applications. They enable organizations to streamline their operations, improve efficiency, and ensure consistent execution of business processes across the enterprise.
# Automation Shapes
In the Pega Platform, automation shapes are graphical elements used in designing automation workflows within Pega's low-code environment. These shapes are part of the Process Model canvas in Pega's App Studio and represent various steps, actions, and decision points in a business process automation. Here are some common automation shapes in the Pega Platform:

1. **Start Shape**: Represents the beginning of a process flow.

2. **Flow Shape**: Represents a step or task within the process flow. It can include actions such as data manipulation, decision-making, or integration with external systems.

3. **Subprocess Shape**: Allows the encapsulation of a set of activities into a separate subprocess, aiding in modularity and reusability.

4. **Decision Shape**: Represents a decision point where the flow branches based on conditions evaluated during runtime.

5. **Connector Shape**: Represents a connection point between different parts of the process flow, enabling transitions between shapes.

6. **End Shape**: Represents the conclusion of a process flow.

7. **Wait Shape**: Delays the execution of the process flow for a specified duration or until a certain condition is met.

8. **Utility Shape**: Represents utility tasks that perform actions like logging, sending emails, or executing custom scripts.

9. **Assignment Shape**: Represents a task assigned to a user or a work queue for manual processing.

10. **Error Handling Shape**: Used for handling errors or exceptions that may occur during the execution of the process flow.

These shapes can be arranged and connected to define the logic and sequence of activities in a business process. Pega's low-code capabilities allow business users and developers to visually design and configure these automation workflows without the need for extensive coding, accelerating the development of applications and automations within the platform.
