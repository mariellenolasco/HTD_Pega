# Duplicate Cases in Pega
In Pega, duplicate cases refer to multiple instances of the same case type or work item that have been created unintentionally or redundantly. Duplicate cases can arise due to various reasons, such as system errors, user mistakes, or inconsistencies in data entry. Managing duplicate cases effectively is essential to ensure data integrity, streamline processes, and avoid unnecessary duplication of effort. 

**Why Identify Duplicate cases?**

**Impact on Data Quality**: Duplicate cases can adversely affect data quality and reliability within a Pega application. They can lead to inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and confusion in data reporting, analysis, and decision-making processes. Managing duplicate cases is critical to maintaining data integrity and ensuring the reliability of information within the system.

**Identifying duplicate cases:**

- **Identification**: Identifying duplicate cases is the first step in managing them effectively. Pega provides features and tools to help users identify potential duplicate cases, such as case search functionality, duplicate detection rules, or automated case matching algorithms.

- **Criteria for Duplication**: Duplicate cases may be identified based on various criteria, such as matching case IDs, similar case attributes or properties, or specific business rules defined by the organization. The criteria for determining duplication may vary depending on the context and requirements of the application.


**Resolving Duplicate Cases**

Once duplicate cases are identified, they need to be resolved or consolidated to eliminate redundancy and avoid confusion. Pega provides tools and functionalities to facilitate the resolution of duplicate cases, such as case merging, data reconciliation, or automated workflows for handling duplicates.


**Preventing Duplicate Cases**

Preventing the creation of duplicate cases is preferable to resolving them after the fact. Pega offers features and best practices to help prevent the occurrence of duplicate cases, such as validation rules, data entry controls, and user training on data entry protocols.

**Auditing and Monitoring Duplicate Cases**

Monitoring and auditing duplicate cases can help organizations identify trends, root causes, and areas for improvement in their processes and data management practices. Pega provides reporting and analytics capabilities to track duplicate case occurrences and analyze their impact over time.

**Summary**
