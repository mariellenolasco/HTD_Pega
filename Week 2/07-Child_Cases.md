# Child Cases in Pega
In Pega, child cases refer to cases that are created as subcases or child cases of a parent case. These child cases are often related to the parent case and are typically created to manage a specific aspect or task within the broader context of the parent case.

Here's a breakdown of child cases in Pega:

1. **Subcases**: Subcases are cases that are directly related to and created within a parent case. They are used to represent smaller tasks or components of the overall parent case. Subcases inherit properties and behaviors from their parent case but can also have their own specific attributes and processes.

2. **Related Cases**: In Pega, you can establish relationships between cases using the "Related Cases" functionality. This allows you to link cases together based on predefined relationships such as parent-child, sibling, or any other custom relationships. Related cases can be used to represent dependencies or associations between different cases.

3. **Child Work Objects**: In addition to subcases, Pega also supports the concept of child work objects, which are instances of a different class that are associated with a parent case. Child work objects may represent tasks, activities, or other work items that are related to the parent case but are not necessarily treated as subcases.

4. **Hierarchy and Parent-Child Relationships**: Pega allows you to define hierarchical relationships between cases using the "Parent Case" field. This field establishes a parent-child relationship between cases, enabling you to organize and manage cases in a hierarchical structure.

Overall, child cases in Pega provide a flexible mechanism for managing complex business processes by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable components while still maintaining the context and relationship between different parts of the process.
