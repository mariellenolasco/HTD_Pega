# Configuring UI 
Configuring user interface elements, dashboards, and portal content in Pega involves using various tools and features within the Pega Platform. 

**Using App Studio or Dev Studio**

Pega provides two main interfaces for application development: App Studio for low-code development and Dev Studio for more advanced development tasks. You can use these interfaces to configure user interface elements, dashboards, and portal content.

**Designing User Interface Elements**:
   - **Harnesses**: Harnesses are containers for sections and other user interface elements. You can create harnesses to define the layout and structure of your application's screens.
   - **Sections**: Sections are reusable components that define the content and behavior of a portion of a screen. You can create sections to display data, capture user input, or perform specific actions.
   - **Fields and Controls**: Pega provides a variety of pre-built field types and controls that you can use to capture user input and display data. These include text inputs, dropdowns, buttons, and more.
   - **UI Gallery**: Pega offers a UI Gallery where you can explore and customize pre-built UI components to enhance the look and feel of your application.

**Configuring Dashboards**:
   - **Report Definitions**: You can create report definitions to define the data that will be displayed on your dashboards. Report definitions allow you to aggregate and analyze data from various sources within your application.
   - **Dashboards**: Pega allows you to create dashboards to display key metrics, charts, and reports in a centralized location. You can configure dashboards using drag-and-drop functionality to add and arrange widgets.
   - **Widgets**: Widgets are components that display specific types of content on a dashboard, such as charts, gauges, lists, and reports. You can customize widgets to visualize data in different formats and styles.

**Configuring Portal Content**:
   - **Portals**: Portals serve as the entry points into your Pega applications for users. You can configure portals to provide users with access to the functionality and information they need.
   - **Navigation Rules**: You can define navigation rules to control how users navigate through your application. Navigation rules specify which screens and actions users can access based on their roles and permissions.
   - **Dynamic Layouts**: Pega offers dynamic layout components that allow you to create responsive and adaptive portal interfaces. You can configure dynamic layouts to adjust the layout and content based on factors such as screen size and device type.

**Testing and Iteration**

After configuring user interface elements, dashboards, and portal content, it's important to thoroughly test your application to ensure that it meets the requirements and functions as expected. You can use Pega's built-in testing tools and capabilities to validate your configurations and make any necessary adjustments.

By leveraging these tools and features, you can configure user interfaces, dashboards, and portal content in Pega to create intuitive and efficient applications that meet the needs of your users and stakeholders.
