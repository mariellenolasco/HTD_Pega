# Accessibility in Pega
Enabling accessibility features in Pega is essential for ensuring that users with disabilities can effectively use and interact with your application. 

Pega provides a range of features to support accessibility:

1. **Accessible UI Components**: Pega offers a variety of pre-built UI components that are designed to be accessible. These components include input fields, buttons, menus, and navigation elements that adhere to accessibility standards such as WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications).

2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure that users can navigate through your application using keyboard controls alone. Pega applications should support keyboard shortcuts for common actions and allow users to easily navigate between interactive elements.

3. **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Pega applications should be compatible with screen readers such as JAWS (Job Access With Speech) and NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access). This involves ensuring that UI elements are properly labeled and that screen reader users can access all relevant information and functionality.

4. **Contrast and Color Accessibility**: Pay attention to color contrast ratios to ensure that text and interactive elements are easily readable for users with visual impairments. Use color combinations that meet accessibility guidelines to ensure readability for all users.

5. **Semantic HTML Markup**: Pega generates HTML markup for UI components dynamically. Ensure that the generated markup is semantic and properly structured to facilitate accessibility. Use appropriate HTML elements and attributes to convey the purpose and structure of the content.

6. **Accessible Forms**: Design forms in your Pega application with accessibility in mind. Ensure that form fields are properly labeled, provide clear instructions, and use error messages that are understandable for screen reader users.

**Pega Best Practices**

**Testing with Assistive Technologies**

Test your Pega application with assistive technologies such as screen readers and keyboard navigation tools to identify and address accessibility issues. Conduct usability testing with users who have disabilities to gather feedback and improve the accessibility of your application.

**Accessibility Guidelines and Standards** 

Familiarize yourself with accessibility guidelines and standards such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure that your Pega application complies with industry best practices.

By incorporating these features and best practices, you can ensure that your Pega application is accessible to users with disabilities, providing an inclusive user experience for all.
