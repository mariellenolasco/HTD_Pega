# Clipboard Tool
In Pega, the Clipboard tool is a fundamental feature that allows developers and administrators to inspect, debug, and manipulate data during the execution of processes and rules within the Pega Platform. It provides a real-time view of the data and objects being processed by the system, enabling users to understand how data flows through the application and troubleshoot issues more effectively.


**Accessing the Clipboard**

You can access the Clipboard tool from the developer toolbar or through the Pega Designer Studio interface. It is typically available to users with appropriate permissions, such as developers and system administrators.

**Clipboard Structure** 

The Clipboard tool organizes data into a hierarchical structure of pages and properties. Each page represents a data object, while properties contain individual pieces of data.

**Data Inspection**

With the Clipboard tool, you can inspect the values of properties and pages at runtime. This allows you to see the current state of data as it progresses through the system.

**Debugging** 

The Clipboard tool is invaluable for debugging processes and rules in Pega applications. You can use it to trace the flow of data, identify potential issues, and verify that data is being processed correctly.

**Property Values**

In addition to viewing property values, you can also modify them directly within the Clipboard tool. This can be useful for testing scenarios or troubleshooting data-related issues.

**Clipboard Pages** 

The Clipboard tool displays various types of pages, including primary pages, step pages, data pages, and clipboard pages. Each type of page serves a different purpose and may contain different sets of data.

**Clipboard Views**: 

Pega offers different views within the Clipboard tool, such as the XML view and the Tree view. These views provide alternative ways to visualize and interact with data in the Clipboard.

**Performance Monitoring**

Beyond debugging, the Clipboard tool can also be used for performance monitoring and optimization. By analyzing data flow and processing times, you can identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in your application.

Overall, the Clipboard tool is a powerful utility in Pega that empowers developers and administrators to understand, analyze, and manipulate data during runtime. It plays a critical role in troubleshooting, debugging, and optimizing Pega applications.
