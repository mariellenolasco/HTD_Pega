# Default Property Values
In Pega, you can set default property values in several ways to ensure that properties have initial values when a case is created or updated. 

Here are some common methods to achieve this:

1. **Property Initialization**: You can set default values directly within the property rule form. When defining or editing a property in Pega Designer Studio, you have the option to specify a default value in the "Default" field. This value will be used as the initial value for the property when a new case is created.

2. **Data Transform**: You can use a data transform rule to set default values for properties during the case creation process. Within the data transform rule, you can specify the default values for individual properties using "Set Value" actions.

3. **Activity**: You can use an activity rule to set default property values programmatically. Within the activity, you can use "Property-Set" methods to assign default values to properties based on specific conditions or business logic.

4. **Field Value Rules**: Field value rules allow you to define default values for properties based on specific conditions. You can create field value rules in Pega Designer Studio and reference them from property rules to set default values dynamically.

5. **Pre-Data Transform and Post-Data Transform Processing**: Pega provides hooks for pre-data transform and post-data transform processing, where you can execute custom logic before or after the data transform is applied. This allows for additional customization and flexibility in setting default property values.

6. **Data Page Initialization**: If you are using data pages to populate property values dynamically, you can configure the data page to initialize properties with default values when it is loaded.

By using these methods, you can ensure that properties in your Pega application have appropriate default values, which can improve usability, streamline case processing, and enforce consistency in data entry.
