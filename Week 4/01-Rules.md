# Rules
## Definition:
Individual components that define the behavior, logic, and presentation of various aspects within a Pega application. They encapsulate specific business logic and are used to implement different functionalities, such as data processing, user interface design, decision making, and integration with external systems.

## Rule Maintenance
- Rule instances can be created, modified, and deleted using the App Studio or Dev Studio within Pega.
- Version control mechanisms allow developers to track changes to rule instances and revert to previous versions if needed.
- Proper documentation and commenting help maintain clarity and understanding of rule functionality.
- Regular reviews and audits ensure rule quality, consistency, and compliance with organizational standards and best practices.

## Rule Types in Pega
In Pega, rule types are categories or classifications of rules based on their purpose, functionality, and usage within a Pega application. Each rule type represents a specific type of component or artifact that defines a particular aspect of the application's behavior, logic, or presentation. Rule types serve as the building blocks of Pega applications, enabling developers to define, configure, and manage various aspects of the application's functionality.

Some common rule types in Pega:

1. **Activity**: Activity rules define procedural logic and are used to perform tasks or operations within the application. Activities can execute a series of steps, such as data manipulation, decision-making, or integration with external systems.

2. **Flow**: Flow rules define the sequence of steps in a business process or case. They specify the actions that users need to take to complete a process and provide guidance on the flow of work through the application.

3. **Section**: Section rules define the layout and appearance of user interface components. They specify the arrangement of fields, buttons, and other UI elements on a screen or form and control how data is presented to users.

4. **Harness**: Harness rules define the overall layout and structure of a user interface screen or portal. They provide a framework for organizing and displaying sections, controls, and other UI elements within a Pega application.

5. **Data Type**: Data type rules define the structure and properties of data objects or instances within the application. They specify the attributes of data elements, such as their data type, length, and validation rules.

6. **Decision Table**: Decision table rules define business rules in a tabular format. They specify conditions and corresponding actions to be taken based on the values of input parameters, allowing for dynamic decision-making within the application.

7. **Connectors**: Connector rules define integration points with external systems or services. They specify the configuration settings and communication protocols required to interact with external APIs, databases, or web services.

8. **Report Definition**: Report definition rules define queries and filters for retrieving and displaying data from the application's database or other data sources. They specify the criteria for selecting and organizing data in reports and dashboards.

Each rule type serves a specific purpose and plays a unique role in defining the behavior, logic, and presentation of the application. By leveraging rule types, developers can build powerful and customizable applications that meet the needs of their organization and users.

## Rule Availability
In Pega, rule availability determines the visibility and accessibility of a rule instance within a Pega application. Rule availability can be configured to control which users or roles can view, modify, or execute a specific rule. There are several types of rule availabilities in Pega, each serving a specific purpose in managing security, compliance, and governance within the application. Here are the main types of rule availabilities in Pega:

1. **Final**:
   - A rule marked as "Final" is not available for overriding or inheritance by child classes or rulesets.
   - Final rules are considered immutable and cannot be modified or extended in any way.
   - Final rules are typically used for core or foundational rules that should not be altered or customized.

2. **Visible**:
   - A rule marked as "Visible" is accessible and visible to authorized users or roles within the application.
   - Users or roles with the appropriate permissions can view, modify, or execute visible rules as needed.

3. **Editable**:
   - A rule marked as "Editable" can be modified by authorized users or roles within the application.
   - Users or roles with the appropriate permissions can edit and modify editable rules to customize or extend their behavior.

4. **Blocked**:
   - A rule marked as "Blocked" is not available for use within the application and cannot be executed.
   - Blocked rules are effectively disabled and cannot be accessed or invoked by users or processes within the application.

5. **Conditionally Visible**:
   - A rule marked as "Conditionally Visible" is accessible only under certain conditions specified by a visibility condition.
   - Visibility conditions can be defined using expressions or criteria based on properties, roles, or other contextual information.

6. **Conditionally Read-Only**:
   - A rule marked as "Conditionally Read-Only" is editable under certain conditions but read-only otherwise.
   - Read-only conditions can be defined using expressions or criteria based on properties, roles, or other contextual information.

7. **Unavailable**:
   - A rule marked as "Unavailable" is not accessible or visible to users or roles within the application.
   - Unavailable rules are effectively hidden from view and cannot be accessed or executed.

## Rulesets
Rulesets are containers that group related rule instances together for easier management and deployment.
They provide a mechanism for organizing and controlling access to rules based on roles and responsibilities.
Rulesets can be organized hierarchically to support modular application design and inheritance of rules.
Each rule instance belongs to a specific ruleset, which determines its visibility and availability within the application.

## Difference between Rules and Rulesets
1. **Definition**:
   - Rules: Individual components that define specific functionality or behavior within a Pega application.
   - Rulesets: Containers that organize and manage groups of related rule instances.

2. **Granularity**:
   - Rules: Granular units of logic or functionality, such as individual activities, flows, or sections.
   - Rulesets: Higher-level organizational units that group multiple rules together based on common themes or business requirements.

3. **Lifecycle Management**:
   - Rules: Managed individually with version control, documentation, and maintenance.
   - Rulesets: Managed as collections of related rules, with controls for access, deployment, and versioning at the ruleset level.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Rules: Deployed individually or as part of larger application packages.
   - Rulesets: Deployed as cohesive units, allowing for easier management and distribution of related rule instances.
