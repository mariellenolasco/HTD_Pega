# Field Level Auditing
Field-level auditing enables you to monitor changes to important data values in your Cases. From a security perspective, it is useful to track modifications when sensitive data is involved.

You can use field-level auditing to track changes that users make to fields and data fields. Actions for the field are automatically recorded in the History dialog box in the Field History tab. 

An audit entry shows the old value, the new value, who made the change, and when the change occurred. There may be two audit entries for data fields: one entry for modifying the initial value and another entry for adding a new value.

## Importance of Field-Level Auditing
1. **Data Integrity**: Field-level auditing helps ensure the integrity of data by providing a detailed record of changes made to individual fields or properties within data records. This audit trail allows organizations to track modifications, identify discrepancies, and maintain data consistency over time.

2. **Accountability and Transparency**: Field-level auditing promotes accountability and transparency by recording who made each data change, when the change occurred, and what the old and new values of the field are. This information helps organizations track the actions of users and hold them accountable for their data modifications.

3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Many industries and jurisdictions have regulatory requirements that mandate the auditing and tracking of data changes.

4. **Security and Fraud Detection**: Field-level auditing assists in detecting unauthorized or fraudulent activities by capturing suspicious data changes and unauthorized access attempts. Organizations can use the audit trail to investigate security incidents, identify potential breaches, and take appropriate remedial actions to mitigate risks.

5. **Forensic Analysis**: In the event of data breaches, incidents, or disputes, field-level auditing provides valuable forensic evidence that can be used to reconstruct events, identify the root cause of issues, and support legal or regulatory investigations. The detailed audit trail helps establish a timeline of events and trace the actions of individuals involved.

6. **Data Governance and Quality**: Field-level auditing supports effective data governance practices by facilitating data quality monitoring, validation, and compliance with data management policies. Organizations can use audit data to analyze data trends, track data quality metrics, and identify areas for improvement in data management processes.
